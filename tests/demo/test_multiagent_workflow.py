"""
Demonstration test of the complete multi-agent workflow.

This test demonstrates the workflow described in PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md:
1. User sends a message to a crew
2. Supervisor agent receives and analyzes input
3. Supervisor decides whether to answer directly or create a plan
4. If a plan is created, supervisor delegates tasks to agents
5. Agents execute their tasks
6. Supervisor gathers results and responds
7. All conversations are stored in the database

This test can run in two modes:
- API Mode: Uses real HTTP endpoints (requires API server running at localhost:8000)
- Direct Mode: Calls functions directly without HTTP (can run without API server)

Usage:
    # To run in API mode (default, requires server running)
    python tests/demo/test_multiagent_workflow.py
    
    # To run in direct mode (doesn't require server)
    python tests/demo/test_multiagent_workflow.py --direct
